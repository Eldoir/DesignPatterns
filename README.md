# Game Programming Patterns

These patterns are discussed in the awesome [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
Although not all of them are specific to game programming (*Service Locator*, for instance).

## Sequencing

- Double Buffer
- Game Loop
- Update Method

## Behavioral

- Bytecode
- [Subclass Sandbox](DesignPatterns/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/SubclassSandbox.cs)
- Type Object

## Decoupling

- Component
- Event Queue
- [Service Locator](DesignPatterns/DesignPatterns/Decoupling/ServiceLocator.cs)

## Optimization

- Data Locality
- [Dirty Flag](DesignPatterns/DesignPatterns/Optimization/DirtyFlag.cs)
- [Object Pool](DesignPatterns/DesignPatterns/Optimization/ObjectPool.cs)
- Spatial Partition
